Development Log

Brainstorm Ideas (What to do with public data):
	- 

Day 1: 5/11/16
	- Created git repository and eclipse project
	- Linked the repository to a remote GitHub repository
	- Researched how JSON works and how simple examples work in JAVA
	- found sources of public data available online
	
	To-Do: 
	- Get a working copy of code to read in a JSON file from a url 

Day 2: 5/12/16
	- Created a dev log!
	- Researched different ways to create JSON objects in java
	- Completed working code to read JSON file from url by replacing jar file
	
	Resources:
	- New JSON API: https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java
	- Info on reading a JSON file from url in java: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4308554/simplest-way-to-read-json-from-a-url-in-java
	
	To-Do:
	- Look into: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/java/json-1973242.html for built-in java solution
	- parse JSON object into correct format and into JSON Array objects
	- Use parsed JSON data for a purpose in code/ test its functionality
	
Day 3: 5/17/16
	- Explored the hierarchy of JSON data taken from the Internet
	- used exploration techniques to differentiate each level of data between an object and an array
	- Researched to understand how JSON data is structured
	
	Resources:
	- JSON simple info: https://code.google.com/archive/p/json-simple/
	- Project to compare to: https://github.com/maticlikar/LikarSandovalFinal/blob/master/src/Main.java
	
	To-Do:
	- Print all data with correct structure and order
	- Understand classmate's project and how it works
	- Find difference between JSONObject and JSONArray
	
Day 4: 5/19/16
	- Used structure of data to extract individual elements of the data
	- Change json extraction program to print out all elements of data in a list
	- Start tutorial for html and css
	- Build a simple website
	
	To-Do:
	- Start actual Hackathon project on Friday!
	- research public data and brainstorm uses for this data
	- Find other sources of public data than sf OpenData
	- Learn more about website skills
